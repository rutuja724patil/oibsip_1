            <h2>Ajanta Tour</h2>
        </span>
        <br>
        Ajanta Ellora Caves have always been recognized as the gems that represent Indian history and the impressive artistry that existed in the foregone era. These tourist attractions consist of 64 rock-cut caves, located in close proximity from the city of Aurangabad.Today, Ajanta and Ellora Caves are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and exist in the wishlist of many travelers. Since we didn't want your research to be exhausting, we decided to jot down all you need to know before you plan a trip to Ajanta Ellora Caves.Ajanta Caves date back to the time between 2nd century BCE to 480 or 650 CE. Walter M. Spink, the famous history scholar, have stated that the caves were built in two phases (Satavahana Period and Vākāṭaka Period). Some of the caves were not completed and some only had their construction begun for a short time.
        On the other hand, Ellora Caves happen to be younger and have its history dating back to 5th and 10 century CE. The Ellora caves are divided into three parts Hindu Caves, Jain Caves, and Buddhist Caves.
        The site of Ajanta Caves was later abandoned and got covered in thick forest, until 1819 when a British officer rediscovered it. However, Ellora Caves have always had the attention it deserves. Today, the Ajanta and Ellora Caves combine to form a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as announced on 1983.June to March is the best time to visit Ajanta Ellora Caves due to pleasant weather. From June to September (monsoon) the region receives average to plenty of rain showers, which make the exploration experience a delight. While during months of November to February the temperature drops moderately. Summer months (March to May) can actually get hot especially in the daytime. So, try to avoid this season if you're planning a visit to Ajanta and Ellora caves.

                <h2>Visit Taj Mahal</h2>
                <br>
            </span>

            The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.
            The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. The colour combination of lush green scape reddish pathway and blue sky over it show cases the monument in ever changing tints and moods. The relief work in marble and inlay with precious and semi precious stones make it a monument apart.

                    <h2>Hawa Mahal</h2>
                    <br>
                </span>

            The Hawa Mahal in Jaipur is considered as one of the most iconic attractions of the city. The five-storey building looks like a honeycomb of a beehive and it is always windy inside, owing to the numerous windows and jharokhas. This amazing ventilation that the palace enjoys is the reason why it was named as the Hawa Mahal, which literally translates into the “Palace of the Winds”.
            The main purpose behind the construction of this palace was to allow the ladies of the royal family and the court to observe the busy streets of the Johari Bazaar from the many jharokhas of the palace, without being seen themselves. The Hawa Mahal is a five-storey building, and it is the tallest building in the world that has been built without a foundation. It has a curved architecture that leans at an 87 degree angle, and a pyramidal shape which has helped it stay erect for centuries.
            The Hawa Mahal is dedicated to Lord Krishna. It is said that the shape of the building resembles the crown of Krishna. More than a palace, the Hawa Mahal is also a cultural and architectural marvel that reflects a truly harmonious amalgamation of the Hindu Rajput and Islamic Mughal architectural styles. The Rajput style can be seen in the domes canopies and the fluted pillars, while the stone inlay filigree work and the arches are perfect depictions of the Mughal style of architecture.
